  <h1>About Ajith Tripuraneni</h1>

  <p>
    I’m <strong>Ajith Tripuraneni</strong>, a motivated and tech-driven individual currently interning at <strong>Accenture</strong>, where I’m gaining practical experience in enterprise tools like <strong>Workday</strong> involving <strong>EIB, CCW, RaaS, XML, and XSLT</strong> transformations. I have a strong technical foundation in <strong>Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL</strong> with hands-on problem-solving in data structures and software concepts. I’m familiar with <strong>Agile methodologies, Business Analytics, Software Development Life Cycles, and Configuration Management</strong>. My goal is to evolve as a full-stack or integration specialist, combining analytical thinking with practical execution in real-time IT systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond tech, I’m an easygoing and curious learner who enjoys watching <strong>anime</strong>, exploring <strong>tech YouTube videos</strong>, and designing creative <strong>presentations</strong>. I also have a strong interest in <strong>fitness, gaming, and editing</strong>. Anime fuels my imagination and problem-solving mindset, inspiring creativity even in technical areas. I value personal growth, adaptability, and always stay open to learning from people and projects around me. Whether it's debugging code or discussing the latest anime arcs, I bring both passion and balance to whatever I do.
